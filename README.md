I love Minesweeper, so I decided to program it in Python (with pygame).  
Try to win by placing flags on all the mine tiles and revealing every non-mine tile!  
Controls: Left click to reveal a tile, Right click to place a flag.  

I recommend playing in a maximized window.  
If you want to customize the difficulty, you can edit the BOMB_COUNT, GRID_SIZE_X, and GRID_SIZE_Y variables.
